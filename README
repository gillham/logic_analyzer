SUMP compatible logic analyzer for Arduino
==========================================

This Arduino sketch implements a SUMP protocol compatible with the standard
SUMP client as well as the alternative client from here:
	http://www.lxtreme.nl/ols/

The alternative client version is highly recommended.  Download version "ols-0.9.7"
or newer for built-in device profiles.

This SUMP protocol compatible logic analyzer for the Arduino board supports
5 channels consisting of digital pins 8-12, which are the first 5 bits (0-4)
of PORTB. Arduino pin 13 / bit 5 is the Arduino LED, bits 6 & 7 are the
crystal oscillator pins.
Uncomment CHAN5 below if you want to use the LED pin as an input and have
6 channels.

On the Arduino Mega board 8 channels are supported and 7k of samples.
Pins 22-29 (Port A) are used by default.

To use this with the original or alternative SUMP clients,
use these settings:

Sampling rate: 4MHz (or lower)
Channel Groups: 0 (zero) only
Recording Size:
   ATmega168:  532 (or lower)
   ATmega328:  1024 (or lower)
   ATmega2560: 7168 (or lower)
Noise Filter: doesn't matter
RLE: disabled (unchecked)

Triggering is still a work in progress, but generally works for samples
below 1MHz.  1MHz works for a basic busy wait trigger that doesn't store
until after the trigger fires.
Please try it out and report back.

Older Notes
===========================================================================
NOTE: With v0.11 you can now sample at 4MHz & 2MHz rates in addition to the 
      previous 1MHz and lower rates.  This is done via unrolled loops which
      makes the source code huge and the binary takes much more of the flash.
      v0.11 is just slightly to big for an ATmega168's flash.  You can comment
      out either captureInline2mhz() or captureInline4mhz() and it will fit. 

NOTE: v0.09 switched the channels BACK to pins 8-13 for trigger reliability.
      Please report any issues.  Uncomment USE_PORTD for pins 2-7.

NOTE: The device profiles should be included with this code.  Copy them to the
      'plugins' directory of the client.  The location varies depending on the
      platform, but on the mac it is here by default:
      /Applications/LogicSniffer.app/Contents/Resources/Java/plugins
      [ These are already included in ols-0.9.7 or newer so do not copy them. ]

NOTE: If you are using the original SUMP client, then you will get a
      "device not found" error.
      You must DISABLE the Arduino auto reset feature to use this logic analyzer
      code. There are various methods to do this, some boards have a jumper,
      others require you to cut a trace.  You may also install a *precisely*
      120 Ohm resistor between the reset & 5V piins.  Make sure it is really
      120 Ohm or you may damage your board.  It is much easier to use the
      alternative SUMP client referenced above.
      [ This is no longer needed for the general case and is just here for reference. ]
      [ DO NOT use this resistor unless absolutely necessary due to very old clients. ]

NOTE: This master branch now supports Arduino 1.0 only.
      Checkout branch logic_analyzer_v0_5 for Arduino 22 support.


Release: v0.12 September 6, 2013.
