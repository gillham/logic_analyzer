SUMP compatible logic analyzer for Arduino
==========================================

This Arduino sketch implements a SUMP protocol compatible with the standard
SUMP client as well as the alternative client from here:
	http://www.lxtreme.nl/ols/

This SUMP protocol compatible logic analyzer for the Arduino board supports
5 channels consisting of digital pins 8-12, which are the first 5 bits (0-4)
of PORTB. Arduino pin 13 / bit 5 is the Arduino LED, bits 6 & 7 are the
crystal oscillator pins.
Uncomment CHAN5 below if you want to use the LED pin as an input and have
6 channels.

On the Arduino Mega board 8 channels are supported and 7k of samples.
Pins 22-29 (Port A) are used by default, you can change the 'CHANPIN' below
if something else works better for you.

NOTE:
If you are using the original SUMP client, or using the alternative client
without the device profiles, then you will get a "device not found" error.
You must DISABLE the Arduino auto reset feature to use this logic analyzer
code. There are various methods to do this, some boards have a jumper,
others require you to cut a trace.  You may also install a *precisely*
120 Ohm resistor between the reset & 5V piins.  Make sure it is really
120 Ohm or you may damage your board.  It is much easier to use the
alternative SUMP client referenced above.

The device profiles should be included with this code.  Copy them to the
'plugins' directory of the client.  The location varies depending on the
platform, but on the mac it is here by default:
/Applications/LogicSniffer.app/Contents/Resources/Java/plugins

To use this with the original or alternative SUMP clients,
use these settings:

Sampling rate: 1MHz (or lower)
Channel Groups: 0 (zero) only
Recording Size: 1024 (or lower), 7168 (or lower) for the Arduino Mega
Noise Filter: doesn't matter
RLE: disabled (unchecked)

Triggering is still a work in progress, but generally works for samples
below 1MHz.  1MHz works for a basic busy wait trigger that doesn't store
until after the trigger fires.
Please try it out and report back.

Release: v0.04 August 3, 2011.
